        <h1>Responsive Grid System</h1>
    </header>

    <section id="google-ads-campaign">
                <p>A responsive grid system is a fundamental component of modern web design, allowing websites to adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices, from large desktop monitors to smartphones and tablets</p>
    </section>

    <section id="display-advertising">
        <h2>Grid System Basics</h2>
        <p>A grid system divides a web page layout into columns and rows, creating a structure that helps organize content consistently across different screen sizes. The most commonly used grid systems consist of 12 or 16 columns, offering flexibility in arranging content.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="remarketing-campaigns">
        <h2>Responsiveness</h2>
        <p>The primary goal of a responsive grid system is to ensure that web pages adjust their layout and content presentation dynamically based on the viewport size of the device being used. This responsiveness is achieved through the use of relative units like percentages or viewport widths (vw) rather than fixed pixel values.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="ad-copywriting-and-optimization">
        <h2>Media Queries</h2>
        <p>Responsive grid systems typically employ CSS media queries to define breakpoints where the layout adjusts to accommodate different screen sizes. For example, a grid might have breakpoints at 768px for tablets and 480px for smartphones, triggering layout changes as the viewport width crosses these thresholds.</p>

    <h2>Fluid Layouts</h2>
    <p>Responsive grids often utilize fluid or liquid layouts, where column widths are specified as percentages of the container width rather than fixed pixel values. This allows content to expand or contract based on the available space, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.</p>
  </section>

<section id="display-advertising">
    <h2>Framework Integration</h2>
    <p>Many web designers and developers utilize front-end frameworks like Bootstrap, Foundation, or Tailwind CSS, which include built-in responsive grid systems. These frameworks provide pre-defined grid classes and components that streamline the process of creating responsive layouts.</p>

    <h2>Flexbox and CSS Grid</h2>
